[one word sung only once] [female-vampire whispers] You're here, Welcome to our digital cafe- Where poetry is sung in whispers and in short spurts and everything is consciously ready to praise the Lord God Almighty.  Join us. or not. We pray that you will . If you choose to walk away. You're a free spirit, aren't ya?  However, when you stay, you will find out why many never leave.  Greetings I'm Miki-Neko. I escaped the hands of mad lab scientist s who gave me human skills and DNA but Yeshua gave me a new life in his paradise. Perfect freedom. Perfect DNA. And our coffee is better than anything you've ever dreamed of. That's because it tastes like nothing you've ever tasted. It only exists in our realm and yes, it requires that you have a bit of an imagination. So be free - experience what life brings when you can conceive a little thing - like a thought of the most real - natural - fresh - elusive coffee and tea beverages that never existed - speak declare and dream it into existence - is what we say we believe this - always  in the Lord Yeshua Jesus Christ Almighty Name. Selah [echoes softly - and bleeds into Gaelic instrumental electro industrial - then Elizabethan Harps and lyres with dramatic violins but danceable]
